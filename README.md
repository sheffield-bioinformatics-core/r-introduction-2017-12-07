## Overview

R is a highly-regarded, free, software environment for statistical analysis, with many useful features that promote and facilitate reproducible research.

In this course, we give an introduction to the R environment and explain how it can be used to import, manipulate and analyse tabular data. We will also introduce the Bioconductor project, 

After the course you should feel confident to start exploring your own dataset using the materials and references provided. 

## Who should attend this course?



## Aims:- After this course you should be able to:

- Import data and plot graphs
- Create a documented and reproducible piece of R code
- Know how to develop your skills in R after the course
- Install and use Bioconductor packages 

## Objectives:- During this course you will learn about:

- The RStudio interface to R
- The many ways to access help about R
- Basic object types in R
- Importing tabular data into R
- Manipulating data in R
- Using in-built functions
- Basic Plotting
- Customizing plots
- Creating reproducible reports in R

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required, but those attending should be able to use a plain text editor.
- A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, but nothing will be assumed and extremely little will be required.

## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of ***both*** R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course
